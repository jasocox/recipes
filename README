Recipe from allrecipes.com. This will be a combination of a web app for
retreiving the data and a feed service that gets the data.

FEED SERVICE
The feed service will use the actor pattern. The scheduler will be
configurable. There are two feeds, one is the list of recipes and one is for
the recipes themselves. The list of recipes service will only need to run about
once a week. The recipes themselves should be updated at least every couple of
days.

It should be possible to trigger everything to run in case of an emergency.

WEB SERVICE
The web service should serve the recipes. It should also serve "dirty" recipes
that have been updated since last retrieval.
